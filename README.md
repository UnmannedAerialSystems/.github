# Unmanned Aerial Systems Club at Penn State
This is the GitHub repository representing all software efforts by the [Unmanned Aerial Systems](https://www.uas.engr.psu.edu/) club at Penn State University in State College, PA.

We build software for autonomous aircraft, primarily to compete in the annual [SUAS](https://suas-competition.org/) competition in Maryland every summer.
